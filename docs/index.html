<h2>The Ivory Toolkit with the SMRF Retrieval Engine</h2>

<div class="main">

<p>Ivory is a Hadoop toolkit for web-scale information retrieval
research that features a retrieval engine based on Markov Random
Fields, appropriately named SMRF (Searching with Markov Random
Fields).  This open-source project began in Spring 2009 and represents
a collaboration between the University of Maryland and
Yahoo!&nbsp;Research.  Ivory takes full advantage of the <a
href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/">Hadoop</a> distributed
environment (the MapReduce programming model and the underlying
distributed file system) for both indexing and retrieval.  The current
release of Ivory (release 0.2) works with Hadoop 0.20.1 (and requires
certain features only found in that release).  Ivory also uses <a
href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud9/docs/index.html">Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup></a>,
a MapReduce library for Hadoop developed at the University of Maryland
(currently also at release 0.2).</p>

<p>In order to temper expectations, please note that Ivory is not
meant to serve as a full-featured search engine, but rather aimed at
information retrieval researchers who need access to low-level data
structures and who generally know their way around retrieval
algorithms.  As a result, a lot of "niceties" are simply
missing&mdash;for example, fancy interfaces or ingestion support for
different file types.  It goes without saying that Ivory is a bit
rough around the edges, but our philosophy is to release early and
release often.  In short, Ivory is <b>experimental</b>!  If you just
want search capabilities as a "black
box", <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html">Lucene</a>
is a likely a better
choice.  <a href="http://katta.sourceforge.net/">Katta</a> is a
framework for serving distributed Lucene indexes that plays well with
Hadoop clusters.</p>

<p>Ivory was specifically designed to work with Hadoop "out of the
box" on
the <a href="http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/clueweb09/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=ClueWeb09%20Wiki">ClueWeb09
collection</a>, a 1 billion page (25 TB) Web crawl distributed by
Carnegie Mellon University.  The initial release of Ivory is meant to
serve as a reference implementation of indexing and retrieval
algorithms that can operate at the multi-terabyte scale.  Another
interesting experimental aspect of Ivory is it's retrieval
architecture: we've been playing with retrieval engines that directly
read postings from HDFS.  The getting started guide
with <a href="trec.html">TREC disks 4-5</a> provides more details.</p>
